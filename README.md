# ISQA3420---Assignment-1

This is my github repository that includes a data flow diagram which shows processes involved with the submission of a software package and its licenses and vulnerabilities by a developer.  After these software packages are scanned they can be retrieved later on by managers and developers and be compared to policy documents maintained by managers of the company.  Along with the data flow diagram is a dictionary that corresponds, an executive summary that explains how the system will work, and three use cases that will go more in depth with some of the processes.
